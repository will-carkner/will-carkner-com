Every year I try to set some ambitions for what I'd like to accomplish in the time I have. For me this is best done by breaking goals into four categories: Health, Relationships, Work, and Adventure. By writing about these ambitions publicly I will be able to gain more accountability to actually get them done.

## Health

- ≥8 hours of sleep 80% of nights
- Read ≥ 20 minutes per day
- 150kg back squat (current 100kg)
- 150kg RDL (current 95kg)
- 80kg bench press (current ~50kg and ~42.5kg incline)
- Banded dead bugs every day

## Relationships

- ≥ Bi-weekly 1 on 1 with all the close people in my life
- Form a new, real connection with someone ≥1x per month

## Work

- Get accepted into Imperial College London
- Get lab testing started for a prototype of BloodBox
- 625 points in Irish LC
- Ship code everyday

## Adventure

- Do some boxing training
- Hike ≥1x per month
- Guitar improvements through weekly lessons

Here goes life.
