### General Notes

Reading serves two purposes for me; learning and entertainment. When these two aspects are combined into one book it is a great feeling.

I read before sleeping most days as that is when I find I can focus on the content but still wind my mind down.

I also read plenty of articles/blogs, with the [Reeder App](reeder.app). A few of the blogs I read:

- [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)
- [James Clear's 3/2/1](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1)
- [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/)

I have not yet read enough to develop a proper rating system for the books I have read, but I will update this if I create something I think is worth sharing.

### Recent

All of the below books I have read with a book club based in Dogpatch Labs. [Thomas Forbes](https://thomasforbes.com) and I set this up and it has been very beneficial for accountability and discussion.

We create somewhat comprehensive notes on each book, and if you want any of these notes or want to join the book club please reach out to me.
