### At the moment

Currently, I am working on three main things, and they are:

- College. Studying Engineering at Trinity College Dublin, 2nd year.

- RF Electronics. Self-teaching the AARL Handbook and building mini projects.

- Rowing. Training a lot and racing on the TCD rowing team.

### 3 at a time

I like the maxim of only working on 2-3 major things at one time. It helps me to remain focused on what is truly important each day.

Also, by keeping three slots for work, I am forced to break each project into smaller chunks or else there will be significant clogs and nothing will get done.

Oliver Burkeman discusses this idea well in [four thousand weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals).

### Enjoying myself

This time of my life is special. I don't have obligations and that is true in different way than ever before. I'mk going to do my absolute best to enjoy it as much as possible.
