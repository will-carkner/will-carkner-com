- work on ambitious, hard work
  - I find it exciting and added benefit of it being pos for humanity
  - brings humanity forward
  - keeps me mentally stimulated (say it in cleaner words)
- reference why you should build hardware
  - work where work isn't being done
  - physical world -> physical things needed
- directly impact the development of others
  - younger people a step behind
  - cascade effect
  - exciting
- efficiency with impact
  - efficiency is appreciated but not always needed
  - sometimes uneffecient things have great
- friendship impacts
  - link back to other impact
- impact over everything?
  - not necessarily -> exciting over everything, but that links to impact
