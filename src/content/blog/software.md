How do you know when software is good? I think software is best when it feels like _magic._

Signing up, getting started, and then actually using the product should feel like when you go to the grocery store and everything on your list is there in stock. There's no need to mess around with email codes not delivering, long sign-up forms, and a plethora of onboarding emails to "get you started using xyz"

## Who does it best?
