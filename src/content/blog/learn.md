One of the most fun things in life for me is learning. Learning makes me feel alive. New understanding builds on the old and makes me better.

## Learn fast

Sometimes I attempt to challenge myself to learn as quickly as I can, while still understanding the content to a high degree.

> There is no speed limit.

This really speaks to what is possible beyond my typical assumed limitations. Conventional wisdom says that certain topics should be learned in fixed amounts of time, but I have found that these "rules" only serve to hold me back.

I have applied this while studying for the Cambridge engineering entrance exam, and it has been insane to see the speed differences of maths learning compared to what I am used to in school.

I sometimes think it sounds egotistical to believe that you can learn faster than average, but through actual scenarios where I have been tested against others, I am able to hold up. Being backed up by evidence is good, although it doesn't remove the awkwardness felt when discussing my advances in speed.

## Concrete progress

One of the most important things for any learning is a sense of concrete progress. Too often I feel stuck in what I am doing and this leads to a lack of motivation.

## Feedback loops

## Deep dives
