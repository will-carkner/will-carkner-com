I love meeting new people, getting exposed to new ideas, having a good time, playing sports, and talking about challenging topics.

## Let's talk about...

Right now I'm interested in AI, mechanical engineering, philosophy, cooking, cycling, sea swimming, maths, design, reading, podcasts, and much more.

I am open to new things and love trying out something I haven't tried before, and this list is constantly changing.

## Questions I have

I'd be really interested to talk to you if you also find some of these interesting. Also, I appreciate people with their own questions.

- What aspects of human dreaming can we bring forward to artificial neural networks in order to come closer to achieving AGI?
- What is the defining feature of consciousness?
- How many calories does it take for an adult man to dig a 500m deep hole?
- Do humans have an upper limit on lifespan?
- And many more!

## How

We can meet in person in Dublin, or if I'm in your city we can meet. I'm also open to meeting online, but I prefer in person.

Reach out to me via [twitter](https://x.com/carknerwill) or _will_ [at] _willcarkner_ [dot] _com_, and let's talk!
