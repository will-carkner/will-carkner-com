## Want to hire me?

I am open to work right now. I'm fairly agnostic to the type of work - could be:

- Web development
- Design
- Web app building
- Automation scripting
- CAD
- Much more!

## Why me?

I'd be a good fit for you if you need high-quality, efficient delivery of a project or task. I can take something from idea to reality in a short time. I pride myself on delivering great quality at a fair price.

If this sounds interesting, you can reach me by email at _will_ [at] _willcarkner_ [dot com] or put in a request [here](https://tally.so/r/mYoJRN).
