### At the moment

Currently, I am working on three main projects, and they are:

- Internship @ Imperial College London, working on metagenomics. I am creating a tool to benchmark existing strain identification programs and will publish my research in the next 3 months.

- Improvements in Maths + Physics in preparation for university entrance exams, including the Cambridge Engineering assessment.

- This personal website (writing posts + improving based on feedback)

I have found that by recording what I am working on, I am actually able to see what needs to be at the front of my mind versus on the back-burner.

### 3 at a time

I like the maxim of only working on 2-3 major things at one time. It helps me to remain focused on what is truly important each day.

Also, by keeping three slots for work, I am forced to break each project into smaller chunks or else there will be significant clogs and nothing will get done.

Oliver Burkeman discusses this idea well in [four thousand weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), which on a side note was extremely valuable for me as a way to rethink the cram-productivity culture I have been brought up in.
