Conventional wisdom says that certain topics should be learned in fixed amounts of time, but I have found that these \"rules\" only serve to hold me back.\n\nI have applied this while studying for the Cambridge engineering entrance exam, and it has been insane to see the speed differences of maths learning compared to what I am used to in school.\n\nI sometimes think it sounds egotistical to believe that you can learn faster than average, but through actual scenarios where I have been tested against others, I am able to hold up. Being backed up by evidence is good, although it doesn't remove the awkwardness felt when discussing my advances in speed.\n\n## Concrete progress\n\nOne of the most important things for any learning is a sense of concrete progress. Too often I feel stuck in what I am doing and this leads to a lack of motivation.\n\nBy making small steps to achieve my learning goals, I am able to wire my brain with a reward pipeline that does not get discouraged.\n\nSometimes small steps are not enough, and you need external markers to give a concrete sense of progress.\n\n### Valuable intent\n\nThis sense of progress can come in many forms, but I find that the most potent is valuable intent.\n\nValuable intent is feedback/advice/comments from individuals that has both value (monetary or otherwise) and relevance. This could be as simple as someone purchasing a product that you have made.\n\n## Feedback loops\n\nFeedback loops are crucial when I want to learn something myself. This is most true in something like coding where the solution created either works or doesn't, and you are able to find that result extremely quickly. This means that you can learn from what went wrong and iterate quickly.\n\nThrough iteration you are able to rapidly increase your proficiency in a topic, and I find that deeper understanding is reached when you have first failed.\n\nFeedback loops can also come in the form of human feedback. This is why tutoring works so well. 1 on 1 time with a knowledgeable person creates practically instantaneous feedback loops, leading to hyper-rapid improvement. [Bloom's 2 sigma problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem) reflects this.\n\n## Deep dives\n\nSomething I have tried recently is the concept of a \"deep dive\". I pick a topic that interests me, whether that be game theory, supplements, poker, or anything really, and expand on the knowledge I have on the topic.\n\nThe way I usually do this is similar to the programming algorithm of depth-first-search. I start with the aspect of the topic that fascinates me, and then this often links into other areas of the field.\n\nGoing down a rabbit hole for a few hours or even days is super enjoyable and it creates new links in my brain. If the knowledge is not applicable to me at that instant, I still have good faith that it will become useful in my future.\n\nAs an example, here is a link to the deep dive I have done recently on [metagenomics](https://willcarkner.notion.site/Metagenomics-b653d408706d47ce8432d5e8c84436e3?pvs=4).\n\n## Takeaway\n\n- Learning fast is not only possible, it's the way to go in some cases\n- Concrete progress and feedback loops are an expressway to learning\n- Deep dives are an interesting way to learn about something different than what I'm used to","src/content/blog/learn.md","07674736828b0afe",{html:111,metadata:112},"<p>One of the most fun things in life for me is learning.

The only real question is where in the electricity market to place these bets?\n\n## The 3 layers\n\nThe electricity industry across the world is broken down into three main segments:\n\n- Generation (converting energy rich materials into electrons)\n- Transmission (moving these electrons around)\n- Usage (converting these electrons back into useful work)\n\nAll of these segments are huge in themselves. Generation is a ~$250B market in the US every year. Utilities are increasing prices, more generation is coming online, and the system continues to grow. The most notable thing however is that there is a main area that is currently more ignored than the rest, and that is transmission.\n\n## Transmission ignorance?\n\nGetting electrons from one place to another is not particularly sexy. It involves a mess of transformers, high voltage (HV) lines, substations, underground cabling, constant repairs to poles, tree pruning, massive transmission towers, and general babying of the overall system to prevent against outages.\n\nBecause of this headache, there are a huge amount of bottlenecks to electricity transmission that have not been solved. One of the most notable is congestion, simply meaning there is not enough power line capacity to transmit the huge number of electrons demanded, causing a lack of available power.

This is a serious issue that utilities are running into **now**.\n\nThis is kind of perfect for us, the somewhat informed investor. When demand for more energy continues to rise, demand for transmission will follow, and companies working on smoothing these bottlenecks will have a field day.\n\n## How to capitalize on transmission\n\nLet's get into the nitty gritty. What about transmission can actually be invested in?\n\nFirstly, there are your major utilities (<a href=\"https://www.pge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PG&E</a> in California, <a href=\"https://esb.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">ESB</a> over here in Ireland). These companies often have the task of final electricity delivery to home or commercial settings, which is a high op-ex business. It's also incredibly messy since people have to constantly be fixing poles after storms, upgrading LV transformers, installing meters, and the like.\n\nNext, one can turn to transformer companies, the large suppliers being <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GE Vernova</a>. A good business to be in to say the least. Both are up >50% in the last 6mos.\n\nAnother approach is to look to Infrastructure and transmission builders, the main player being <a href=\"https://quantaservices.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quanta Power</a>. These companies are crucial when looking to build new transmission. I don't see demand doing anything other than increasing for these guys.\n\nThe final outlook that I believe is promising is with power electronics companies. Guys doing inverters, converters, and rectifiers. Cool companies like <a href=\"https://www.wolfspeed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfspeed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xppower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">XP Power</a> are pushing the envelope here.\n\n## An example portfolio\n\nNow for the fun part. To put my money in. As an experiment, I've created a simple portfolio and invested ~5% of my net worth into it. The details are as follows. These positions were obtained as of 19/09/25.\n\n**Growth**:\n\n- Quanta Services (PWR) 20%\n- Fluence Energy (FLNC) 20%\n\n**Backbone**:\n\n- Siemens Energy (ENR) 25%\n- GE Veranova (GEV) 25%\n\n**Moonshot:**\n\n- Wolfspeed (WOLF) 10%\n\n## Riskier bets\n\nTo me, the cooler companies are the ones innovating in the space. Heron Energy is building transformers using modern power electronics. LineVision is doing grid intelligence software. These are where the ball is rolling. Time to get in while the iron heats up.\n\nThe main way I aim to invest in this industry is to become a part of it. I'm still trying to find out the best place in the stack for a company to slide in.

I've started to collate these modifications:\n\n- _Complaining_ -> often the easy (but wrong) way out of a situation is to complain. After seeing the diversity of life experiences that exist, I am doing my best to minimize how much I complain. Not only because my problems are insignificant, but because complaining achieves nothing and is annoying to be around. Better for me, and for those around me.\n- _Sincerity_ -> when in Zambia, I was asked \"how are you\" quite a bit. Every time this was asked it was looking for a genuine answer and it wasn't an automatic exchange. I need to alter my autopilot in this regard, since it definitely makes for a stronger connection between strangers.\n- _Sheltering_ -> I want to see as much of the world as possible. Meet people, see places, make an impact. I knew this before, but it's even more concrete now. Uniqueness drives me.\n\n# Observations\n\nI also made a few observations about Zambia. These are probably not fully correct/completely unique, and are subject to change as I diversify my life experiences.\n\n- Sport unifies across cultures.\n- Lack of \"middle class\" seems to be a large difficulty in Zambia. There are two sides of the wealth spectrum, but unfortunately not an income bracket that seems attainable for the \"average\" Zambian.\n- Link between peaceful country + economic growth -> see The Wealth of Nations\n\n# Future plans\n\nAfter visiting Zambia, a few things are going to change immediately in my life.
